The client should have a UI so that the User can choose between various actions.

Ex:
    > 1 - Creat chat

        #Inside "Creat Chat":
        
            > name of the chat: 
            bom_dia_guimaraes
            > Created chat: bom_dia_guimaraes
        #goes back to the first menu

    > 2 - Go to chat

        #Inside "Go to chat"

            #displays all chat that the client is in
            > 1 - bom_dia_guimaraes
            > 2 - mau_dia_braga
            >select a chat

            #Inside the selected chat

                > 1 - chat (mandar e recever mensagens)
                    #Inside "chat"
                    *Exchange messages
                    *the command "!exit" will go back

                > 2 - add client    (invite client)
                    #Inside "add client"
                    *list every client  (generic listing)
                    > ? - exit
                    >select the client to be added

                > 3 - get out of the chat
                    #Inside "get out of the chat"
                    *lists every chat that the client is in
                    > ? - exit
                    select the chat
                    
                > 4 - exit
                    *goes back
